# max happiness
Thomas has R units of Money and goes to a bakery to have some pastries. Every pastry costs him 1 unit of money and there is an infinte supply of all kinds of patries. The bakery has N different kinds of pastries.
The i-th pastry has some ai and bi value associated with it. When Thomas eats the i-th pastry for the first time, he gets ai amount of happiness. When he eats the i-th pastry for the second time, he gets (ai - bi)amount of happiness and so on. When he eats the i-th pastry for the k-th time, the amount of happiness he gets is equal to max (0, ai - (k-1)*bi). 
Calculate the maximum amount of happiness Thomas can get with the amount of money he has. 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integer values of N and R. The second line contains N space separated pairs of integer (ie, 2*N integers) denoting the values of ai and bi. 

Output: 
Print a single integer denoting the maximum amount of happiness that Thomas can gain with the given amount of money he has.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxHappiness() which takes the array a[], the array b[], their size N and amount of money R as inputs and returns the maximum amount of Happiness that Thomas can gain with R amounts of Money.
Since the result can be very large, return the result mod 998244353.

Constrains:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= |N|, |R| <= 2*106
1 <= ai, bi <= 2*106

Example:
Sample Input:
2
2 3
8 2 7 2
2 10
5 1 10 5

Sample Output:
21
30

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
Thomas eats the 0-th pastry and gains happiness 8.
Then he eats the 1-st pastry and gains happiness 7.
Then he eats the 0-th pastry and gains happiness 8-2 = 6.
After this, he exhausts all his money. Hence, the total amount of Happiness = 8 + 7 + 6 = 21.
